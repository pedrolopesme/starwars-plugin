## Star Wars Jenkins Plugin is an OPEN Open Source Project

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
1. Pull requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
1. Use a non-`master` branch for ongoing work.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code style.
1. Run `mvn test` locally before submitting your PR to catch testing issues

## Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.

## Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document is subject to pull requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have something valuable to add or change.
